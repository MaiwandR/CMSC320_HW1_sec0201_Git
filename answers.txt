Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git is a distributed version control system that lets teams track and revert changes, work in parallel on branches without breaking main, merge and review code via pull requests, maintain a complete history/audit trail, recover quickly from mistakes, and sync work across machines/remotes—all of which improves reliability, collaboration, and productivity.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: Data science is used across many industries—healthcare (predicting readmissions), finance (fraud detection), retail/e-commerce (recommendations and demand forecasting), marketing (customer segmentation), transportation/logistics (route and ETA optimization), and manufacturing (predictive maintenance). Example: an online retailer analyzes browsing and purchase history to recommend products and forecast demand, reducing stockouts and boosting sales.
