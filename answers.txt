Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git is a distributed version control system that lets teams track and revert changes, work in parallel on branches without breaking main, merge and review code via pull requests, maintain a complete history/audit trail, recover quickly from mistakes, and sync work across machines/remotesâ€”all of which improves reliability, collaboration, and productivity.
